- Accent color: Muted blue (#7FB7BE) to highlight interactive elements, creating contrast without overwhelming the primary color.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern and readable interface. Headline Font: 'Playfair' (serif) to provide elegance to titles.

- Use subtle animations for transitions and user interactions to provide a smooth and engaging experience. Example: fade-in effects.
